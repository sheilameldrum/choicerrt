The Choice Reaction Time Task (Deary & Liewald, 2011)
======================================================

Reaction times have been studies for over 100 years and a staple of scientific study in psychology. A commonly used procedure is to study reaction time involves measuring reaction times to a choice of stimulus.

The task
--------------

Deary and Liewald (2011) developed the choice reaction time task that requires participants to respond to one of a number of stimuli. In this task, participants must push one of four response keys that corrrespond to a target stimuli that appears in a corresponding location on screen.

Extensions
--------------

See if you can modify this task so that randomization of the ISI is handled within a code component, rather than using a set ISI from the excel conditions file.
